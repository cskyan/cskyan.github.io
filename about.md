## Biography
Shankai received his Ph.D. degree in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) at [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/) ([4th in QS World University Ranking aged under 50](http://www.topuniversities.com/top-50-under-50) and [5th in Times University Ranking aged under 50](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-young-universities-world)) under the supervision of [Dr. WONG Ka-Chun](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/kc.w.htm). After that, he was awarded the fellowship of [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) and worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Zhiyong Lu's BioNLP Lab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp) at [NCBI/NLM/NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). He is now an associate professor in [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://hd.hainanu.edu.cn/cs/) at [Hainan University](http://en.hainanu.edu.cn). He has published papers with interesting topics on top conference and journals (e.g. [ACL(BioNLP)](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/BioNLP_Workshop), [AMIA](https://amia.org/education-events/amia-2022-annual-symposium), [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics), [FGCS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/future-generation-computer-systems), [JBI](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-biomedical-informatics) and [JBHI](http://jbhi.embs.org/)), demonstrating his solid research skills. His research is mainly about applied machine learning in biomedical and clinical fields. His goal is to facilitate knowledge discovery and decision making in healthcare research communities using AI technology.

Shankai has served as the guest editor for the special issue *Generative AI in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics* for [Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computational-and-structural-biotechnology-journal/about/call-for-papers#generative-ai-in-computational-biology-and-bioinformatics). He has also served as the co-chair at [ISMSI 2024](http://www.ismsi.org/com.html), [ISCMI 2024](http://www.iscmi.us/committees.html) and the session chair at [IEEE UIC 2022](http://www.ieee-smart-world.org/2022/uic/tpc.php), [IEEE ICPADS 2023](https://ieee-cybermatics.org/2023/icpads). He has been the program committee member of [CACML](http://cacml.net), [BIBM](https://bidma.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/IEEE-BIBM-2023), [ICCBB](http://www.iccbb.org), [ICONIP](https://iconip2022.apnns.org), [ACL BioNLP Workshop](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/BioNLP_Workshop), etc. He has served as the peer reviewer for multiple conferences (e.g. ACL, BIGCOM, ICONIP, BIBM, ICHI, DMBD, ISMSI, etc.) and journals (e.g. BIB, Bioinformatics, PlosCB, JAMIA, Database, JBI, CSBJ, IEEE TCBB, CAIS, TCSS, ASOC, FGCS, NCAA, etc.).

Before the Ph.D. study, Shankai obtained his BEng and MEng degrees in [School of Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/software_en/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhang Pingjian](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/software_en/2018/1214/c20555a299972/page.htm). He has also studied at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk) as a visiting student in [Dr. Kathleen Steinh√∂fel's Lab](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/kathleen-steinhofel), cooperating with [Dr. Mariam Molokhia](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/mariam.molokhia.html) and [Dr. Paul Bates](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/paul-bates) at [Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/).
