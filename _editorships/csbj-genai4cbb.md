# Special issue information

Generative AI, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has shown promising impacts in computational biology and bioinformatics. Specifically, it can be developed to create models capable of generating interesting data with the same statistical properties as the training set. This technology has been instrumental in simulating biological systems, predicting 3D molecular structures, and generating genomic sequences. The fusion of generative AI with computational biology and bioinformatics offers potential in understanding complex biological phenomena, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. However, the inherent complexity of biological systems poses challenges that necessitate further research and development in this interdisciplinary field.


# Scope of the Special Issue

The main scope of the upcoming special issue focused on "Generative AI in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics" would be to offer highlights in the field covering the relevant topics from generative AI to computational biology and bioinformatics.

In this special issue, we will explore the potential of generative AI in the wide domains related to computational biology and bioinformatics with good performance at different V’s (volume, velocity, veracity, value, and variety) in the era of big data.

Possible research topics include but are not limited to:

- Biotechnology Development with Generative AI
- Data Integration with Generative AI in Biology
- Ethics of Generative AI in Biology
- Foundation Models in Biology
- Multimodal Generative AI in Biology
- Software Tools with Generative AI in Biology
- Translational Studies with Generative AI in Biology
- Generative AI in Biological Networks, Biological Text Data, Biomedical Images, Cellular Biology, Disease Modelling, Drug Discovery, Epigenetics, Genomics, Genetic Engineering, High-throughput Sequencing, Medicine, Metagenomics, Microbiome Research, Proteomics, and Systems Biology
