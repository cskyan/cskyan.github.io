My research interests are Biomedical Text Mining (BioNLP), Bioinformatics, Text Mining, Data Mining, and Machine Learning. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress. 

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects.
