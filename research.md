My research interests focus on Biomedical Text Mining (BioNLP), Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. My current projects focuses on biomedical relation extraction, biomedical/clinical document classification, and phenotype annotation to facilitate precision medicine. Here you can find materials relevant to my published papers.

I also provide the titles for some working papers and projects in progress below. Full links are attached for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these works.
